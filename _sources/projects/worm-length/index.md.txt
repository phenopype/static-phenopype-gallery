# Worm length

In this project, the length of california blackworms (*Lumbriculus variegatus*) is measured in 6 well plates, which are detected automatically with the Hough Transform algorithm in `detect_mask`.

## Background

Body length is a commonly measured trait. However, live animals are typically not well behaved in front of camera: typically the body is not aligned straight, which makes length measure difficult and sometimes time consuming. Some computer vision can help here, such as [skeletonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_skeleton) for an acurate semi automatic approach, and polyline drawing for a less acurate, manual aproach. phenopype's `detect_mask` can automatically detect geometric objects using [Hough transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hough_transform). It can take a while to fine-tune the right parameters for the circle detection. For this particular project, the below configuration for `detect_mask`(included in the template) proved to be useful for the 6-well plates in the images:

```python
- detect_mask:
    ANNOTATION: {type: mask, id: a, edit: overwrite}
    shape: circle
    circle_args: {max_radius: 300, min_radius: 220, param2: 90, param1: 100, min_dist: 400}
    resize: 0.5
```
